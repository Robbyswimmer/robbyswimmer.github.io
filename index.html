    <h2>About Me</h2>
</div>

<div class="container text-left col-lg-8 col-md-10 col-sm-12">
    <p>I am a Christian, a son to two amazing parents, a brother to six incredible siblings, a competitive swimmer, a student, and a lifelong learner. Currently I am a student at California Baptist University (CBU) where I am studying computer science and a member of the CBU Men's Swim Team. I am a Research Assistant in the Computer Science Department where we are studying the use of IoT in education and the best practices for agile development. On the swim team I have been blessed with the opportunity to serve as a team captain and represent my school while I am training for the 2021 USA Swimming Olympic Trials. </p>
    <p>Over the past 15 years I have had the privilege of pursuing competitive swimming at the highest level. I have qualified for USA Swimming National Championships, I am a six-time USA Swimming Junior National finalist, and I hope to compete at Olympic Trials next year. Being a swimmer for so long has taught me how to work hard, stay committed to my goals, and not quit even in difficult situations. Swimming has given me some of my closest friends and enabled me to become the person that I am today.</p>

<div class="container text-left col-lg-8 col-md-10 col-sm-12">
    <p>Despite having such a busy schedule, one of my favorite things to do is to spend time with my parents and siblings. I am the second of seven children in my family, and my five younger siblings are adopted. Having so many siblings has made my life more fun, and my siblings are my best friends. My parents and my siblings are my biggest supporters and I talk the them every day, even while I am away at school.</p>
    <p>While I have been at school, I have spent countless hours learning more about the discipline of computer science. This past semester I have been able to become involved in research in the computer science department at CBU. It has been incredibly rewarding to learn about new fields within the domain of computer science and to research new ideas that haven’t been written about before. I take academics very seriously, not only because it is important to me to perform well academically, but also because I am passionate about new ideas and the process of learning.</p>
    <p>I have many interests, but right now I am focused on studying computer science, swimming, writing, playing piano, and learning about how I can become a better leader. On this site you can find some of my computer science projects, my resume, links to my social media pages, my GitHub page, and my contact information. Feel free to reach out to me for anything – I would love to get coffee with you, talk on the phone, or discuss any of my projects.</p>
